% oxidized seems to be higher for ASD. Maybe a cutoff @ 0.15 would be useful here to predict. Maybe a decision tree could cut here.



Let's start by (1) ignoring the behavior scores (that's an outcome) and comparing just ASD and NEU.  
We need to drop SIB... and tell the model that we don't actually care about it.

```{r}
data <- 
  autism %>% 
  select(-`Vineland ABC`) %>% 
  filter(Group != "SIB") %>% 
  mutate(Group = factor(Group))
```

```{r}
spec <- workflow() %>% add_recipe(
  recipe(Group ~ ., data = data)) %>%
  add_model(decision_tree(mode = "classification") %>% set_engine("rpart"))
model <- spec %>% fit(data)
```

```{r}
model %>% predict(data, type = "prob")
```

2 cols: how likely they are to have ASD vs NEU. probability.

```{r}
model %>%
  predict(data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(data) %>% 
  mutate(idx = row_number()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = idx, y = .pred_ASD, color = Group, shape = Group)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5) +
  geom_point()
```


Looking @ where the model disagrees could tell us more about the disease, too. 

Quantifying:

```{r}
metrics <- yardstick::metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)
model %>% 
  predict(data, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(data) %>% 
  metrics(truth = Group, estimate = .pred_class)
```

                       Seizure happened -- No seizure happened
    Seizure predicted          TP                     FP
    No seizure predicted       FN                     TN


Accuracy (% correct) = (TP + TN) / (# episodes)
False negative ("miss") rate = FN / (# actual seizures)
False positive ("false alarm") rate = FP / (# true non-seizures)


**Sensitivity:** one that predicts autism in almost every autism case.
*not missing anyone who does have autism!*

**Specificity**: able to distungish well between 
It doesn't classify anyone who 
If you get a positive, you *totally/definitely* have it.

^^ hmmmm not sure about what he was saying here... look it up.


## Logistic Regression

```{r}
#install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)
spec <- workflow() %>% add_recipe(
  recipe(Group ~ ., data = data)) %>%
  add_model(logistic_reg(penalty = .001) %>% set_engine("glmnet")) #don't worry about these
model <- spec %>% fit(data)
```

Look at the coefficient:

```{r}
model %>% pull_workflow_fit() %>% pluck('fit') %>% coef(s = .1) %>% as.matrix() %>% as_tibble(rownames = "name") %>% 
  rename(coef = 2) %>% filter(abs(coef) > .01) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = coef, y = fct_reorder(name, coef, abs))) + geom_col()
```

^ these could just be on a different scale... we forgot to normalize / scale these to be comparable. So, we shouldn't look @ the coefficient quite yet.

```{r}
model %>% predict(data, type = "prob")
```

```{r}
model %>%
  predict(data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(data) %>% 
  mutate(idx = row_number()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = idx, y = .pred_ASD, color = Group, shape = Group)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5) +
  geom_point()
```

Should we have validated this? -- YES! 

```{r}
model %>% 
  predict(data, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(data) %>% 
  metrics(truth = Group, estimate = .pred_class)
```


You can correctly identify this 200 person dataset... so you need cross validation, at least.

```{r}
# cv_results %>% 
#   collect_metrics(summarize = FALSE) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x = .estimate, y = .metric)) + geom_boxplot()
```
