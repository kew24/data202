## Projects
- Project 1: Data Visualization
    - Replicating a WSJ article on COVID-19 cases among age categories in 17 European countries. Demonstrate appropriate data wrangling techniques, use of popular packages (tidyverse/dplyr/ggplot) to produce publication-quality visualization, and write code in a clear/documented/reproducible process.

- Project 2: Data Modeling
    - Replicating findings in a Nature Genetics article. Details coming soon.
